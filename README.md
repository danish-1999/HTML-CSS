This is a practical project to learn - How to build a Responsive  Website and what type of unit should we give to padding,margin , font-size, line-height etc. - in this project  i use  only -  vw , % , px  units.

This  project is  a clone - which i made by watching a  youtube  video link - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HG10yrq1pbk&list=PLbtI3_MArDOkNtOan8BQkG6P8wf6pNVz-&index=13&t=4285s. in the video the  instructor explain  all the concept needed to make a web page Responsive and  instructor show approach to give padding,margin,font-size,line-height etc - vw unit or % unit .in some case px unit also used. The explaination are quite well with practical examples without making it boring like theory.
